Automotive SOFTWARE RELIABILITY GROWTH MODELING: COMPARISON BETWEEN NON-LINEAR REGRESSION ESTIMATION AND MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATOR PROCEDURES
Software reliability may be defined as the probability that software would
be functioning without failure under a given operating condition for a
specified period of time.

In other words, it represents the potential of a computer program or code
to perform a required function under stated conditions for a specified
period of time.

Software reliability growth models (SRGMs) are used to determine the
reliability growth. Reliability is analyzed using different models which may
be based on Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP), Markov
process or Bayesian models.
